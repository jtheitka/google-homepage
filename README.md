From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

Project was to create html and css files to replicate google homepage.

Lots of tinkering with layouts and gave me a better understanding of box model.

Need to revisit at some point to clean up code, as I just did this with a make it work approach.
